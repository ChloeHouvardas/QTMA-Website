Each round, the players will answer a mixture of different question types for the Host to judge at the end. The Host decides on a punishment (e.g. take a shot), a winner, and a loser. The loser must take the punishment while the winner can give the punishment to another player. The loser is then the new host for the subsequent round. Let Hangover be the perfect addition to your night!",
