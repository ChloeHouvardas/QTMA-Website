## QTMA website

The official website for [Queen's Tech and Media Association](https://qtma.ca) (QTMA)!

QTMA is a product development club & tech incubator at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/)
devoted to helping tech & business students successfully plan, design, build and launch software
products which are judged by industry specialists at the end of each school term.

<i>This is the code for the site which can be found at [qtma.ca](https://qtma.ca). Built with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)</i>

## Running locally

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci # Can use 'npm i' but it's slower & re-writes package-lock
```

To start the site, you have a few options:

1. Run in development mode (recommended for dev work):

        next dev
2. Run in production mode:

        next build
        next start
3. View a preview deployment of staging [here](https://qtma-website-git-staging-reid-moffat.vercel.app/)
   (not local, but you can view non-production views)

When running locally, the site is available at http://localhost:3000
