QTMA is a product development club & tech incubator at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/)
devoted to helping tech & business students successfully plan, design, build and launch software
products which are judged by industry specialists at the end of each school term.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)</i>
