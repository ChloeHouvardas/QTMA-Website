# Queens Tech and Media Association (QTMA) www.qtma.ca

QTMA is a start-up accelerator club run by Queens' University students. The club was looking for someone to revamp their website during 2022, and I volunteered to build the club a website so I could take on the challenge of learning Next.js. The website linked in the title is what I produced for the club in two-weeks time.
